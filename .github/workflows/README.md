CI/CD Implementation

When new code is pushed to the main branch, npm run start is run. This ensues that the new code is valid and the application still works. Unit and intergration tests are still missing, 
for example login tests and tests together with the backend servers. A future possible enhancment could be an upload test, where a test picture is uploaded to ensure upload functionality.
